Media2Commerce automatically creates products in WooCommerce from Media image uploads.

== Description ==

Media2Commerce is a plugin that enables you to sell uploaded media directly from WordPress. 

Products are automatically created from images that uploaded using to WordPress. Different variations or types can be created easily eg. small, medium, large

It requires the WooCommerce eCommerce plugin - when media is uploaded a product is created with the image as a downloadable virtual item.

As products are created as downloadable media items, you can specify what default types are created in Settings - Media2Commerce settings. It is feature rich and you can set:

* Default Pricing
* Image Scaling 
* Image Quality

Products assume their name and description from the original media image and caption.
